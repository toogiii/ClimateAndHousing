# ClimateAndHousing

This repository contains the replication code and data for Project 1 for ECON 1680. The code can be replicated by downloading all files, inserting them into a folder, and changing the path variable in the Jupyter notebook to wherever the directory containing the Code, Data, etc. folders is located on your host.

This project leverages both basic Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and dimension reduction techniques to analyze the relationship between risks of different natural hazards (such as wildfires, floods, etc.) and housing price magnitude and volatility. The details and methods used are outlined within the paper and can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
